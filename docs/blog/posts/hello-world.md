# Hello world!

While post URLs are dynamically computed, the built-in blog plugin ensures that all links from and to posts and a post's assets are correct. If you want to link to a post, just use the path to the Markdown file as a link reference (links must be relative):

[Hello World!](blog/posts/hello-world.md)

Linking from a post to a page, e.g. the index, follows the same method:

[Authors](../authors.md)
