# Introduction

The `pharmbio` Python package serves as a toolkit developed for the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics Research Group at Uppsala University, Sweden.

!!! note "Server Connection Dependency and Usage Constraints"

    Please note that the `pharmbio` package is tightly integrated with the data server and file repository infrastructure of the Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics Research Group at Uppsala University. As such, it is not designed to function outside of this specific server workflow. The package is optimized for use within the group's ecosystem and its full range of functionalities are only accessible when connected to the group's server environment. Users should deploy and utilize `pharmbio` with this critical dependency in mind.
